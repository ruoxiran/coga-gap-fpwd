			<p>The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force's aim is to improve web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. This is being done as part of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Accessible Platform Architecture Working Group (APA WG), part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. Challenges facing this work include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lack of availability of open research: Research on this topic tends to be behind a “paywall” which means that developers and policy makers may be unable to find out what techniques are proven to work to address the needs of people with disabilities</li>
				<li>There is a wide range of cognitive disabilities; each type of impairment is different, with diverse symptoms and particular digital accessibility requirements. This adds to the complexity of knowing how to address user needs.</li>
				<li>The advice given in the research and available guidance is often vague and is not testable. So, even if developers read the research they would not know exactly what to do or when they have reached an acceptable level of accessibility.</li>
			    <li>Another major challenge is       capturing difficulties related to cognitive disabilities that may be undeclared.       People with cognitive disabilities may be embarrassed about their       disabilities and may be less likely to request accommodations. They may be       afraid of discrimination, especially in the work place. Others are not       aware of their disability or of the impact it has on their functioning.</li>
                   <li>Attitudes and misinformation can       also become a barrier to inclusion for people with cognitive disabilities.       For example, developers that may feel people with cognitive disabilities       are not in their "target audience" and so have no interest in their       inclusion. Also, studies of usability often over-sample college students. This       can mean that the results work less well for those inadequately       represented among sub-groups of college students (such the aging       population).</li>
			
              <li>Attitudes and misinformation can also become a barrier to inclusion for people with cognitive disabilities. For example, developers that may feel people with cognitive disabilities are not in their “target audience” and so have no interest in their inclusion. Also, studies of usability often over-sample college students. Thus the results work less well for groups who are not well represented among sub-groups of college students (such the aging population).</li>
              <li>Accessibility has typically been based upon the assumption that any website can be designed to be usable by people with disabilities. However, when making a website usable for people with cognitive disabilities, the content itself may need to be changed (e.g. simplified), or support adaptability (e.g. multi-modal delivery).</li>
            </ul>
			<p>Addressing these issues requires us to make a broader view of solutions for accessibility, such as a content focused approach and to explore personalization solutions that incorporate inclusive design. To address these issues we have adopted the following strategies:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select a <strong>phased approach</strong>. In our first phase we looked at eight different disabilities or categories that cut across types of cognitive impairment in terms of severity and brain function. Although some user needs might not have been identified in this phase, this approach made the work involved practical and it is likely that most key needs will have been identified. Other cognitive disabilities and emotional disabilities may be included in  phase 2 and the current user groups may be re-examined.</li>
				<li>Compile <strong>user research</strong> and literature reviews on the selected disability groups. These literature reviews mean that key findings are in the public domain and are easily available.</li>
				<li>Compile a list of <strong>authoring techniques</strong> that include the most useful strategies from all the different user group research&nbsp; </li>
				<li>Create testable and widely adoptable sets of <strong>success criteria</strong> that let authors know exactly what they need to do and when they have completed the task. (This might then be added to WCAG [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WCAG20">WCAG20</a></cite>] for cognitive disabilities)</li>
				<li>Author a series of <strong>issue papers</strong>  [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-coga-issue-papers">coga-issue-papers</a></cite>] that explore topics beyond simple content such as security or personalization.</li>
				<li>Review the techniques and issue papers to <strong>identify the gaps</strong> between what is currently supported in accessibility guidelines and in the web architecture and what is needed to enable accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities</li>
				<li><strong>Create a roadmap</strong> to show how we can fill these gaps.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In addition to this gap analysis we have first drafts of the following accompanying documents: (Note they are works in progress and may change.)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Background research document. <!-- See <a rel="nofollow" href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/coga/user-research.html">https://w3c.github.io/wcag/coga/user-research.html</a>-->(See

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The techniques will also lead to a proposal for a WCAG 2.1  <!-- See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Proposal_for_WCAG">https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Proposal_for_WCAG</a>-->(see appendix two).</li>

			</ul>
			<p>The diagram shows how these need to be integrated to enable accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities</p>

<p>A roadmap must enable the integration  of all the pieces that can make accessibility for people with cognitive  disabilities workable. A roadmap must also address the author needs and issues  that will help make this work practical. For example: Best practice documents  and how to ensure that personalization is practical and testable.</p>

  </figure>
			<p>The diagram shows what we are anticipating moving towards a roadmap. (Note that this work has yet to be completed.)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User research (phase 1)</li>
				<li>Gap analysis</li>
				<li>Author techniques and <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards integration (such as WCAG [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WCAG20">WCAG20</a></cite>] and VOICE ML or ARIA [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-wai-aria">wai-aria</a></cite>])</li>
				<li>Support and possible standardization of preference (user settings) and metadata so that terms and setting are interoperable and user needs can be met across different Web applications. (Integration with other standards). </li>
				<li>Web semantics that enable personalization of content such that web authors can employ mechanisms that adapt Web content to meet the needs of the user according to the&nbsp;user preferences.</li>
				<li>Author support providing examples and supporting materials such as best practices and techniques. Test cases for personalization. </li>
				<li>Middleware and user agent guidance</li>
				<li>Browser and operating system guidance</li>
				<li>Suggestions for tools: For example guidance for authoring and conformance tools and user agents.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Then we can start the process again with  phase 2 for additional research and new user groups, possibly including emotional disabilities.</p>

				<h3 id="x1-1-importance-of-this-document" resource="#x1-1-importance-of-this-document"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">1.1 </span>Importance of This Document<span class="permalink" typeof="bookmark"><a href="#importance-of-this-document" aria-label="Permalink for 1.1 Importance of This Document" title="Permalink for 1.1 Importance of This Document" property="url"><span property="title" content="1.1 Importance of This Document">§</span></a></span></span></h3>
				<p>This document is important because enabling people with learning and cognitive disabilities to use the Web and Web technologies is of critical importance to both individuals and society.</p>
				<p>More  and more, the Internet and the Web have become the main way people stay  informed and current on news and health matters; keep in touch with friends and  family; and it can provide independence such as convenient shopping etc. People  who cannot use these interfaces will have an increased feeling of having a  disability and of being alienated from society. </p>
				<p>
			    Further,  with the advent of the Web of Things, everyday physical objects are connected  to the Internet and have Web interfaces. Being able to use these interfaces now  is an essential component of allowing people to maintain their independence, stay in the work force for longer, and stay safe. </p>
				<p>
			    Consider  that the population is aging. The global share of population aged 60 years or  over is expected to reach 21.1 per cent by 2050 and is typically higher in  developed countries. A majority of people over 60 years old notice a decline in  memory and executive function such as an Age Associated Memory Impairment  (38.4%), Mild Cognitive Impairment (15.3%) or less frequently, dementia (8.8%).  That means more and more people are dependent on others for things that they  could do themselves, increasing the crippling cost of care and reducing human  dignity.</p>
<p>We therefore invite you to review this draft; and comment and consider how your technologies and work may be affected by these issues.</p>

				<p>People with cognitive and learning disabilities may be unable to use web content because of the design choices of the author. Examples include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> People with impaired short term memory are unlikely to be able to remember passwords and access codes. They may have trouble or be unable to remember new symbols and interface paradigms. </li>
					<li>People with language related disabilities may need simple clear language and instructions. They may also need supporting graphics and familiar symbols</li>
					<li>People with communication disabilities may need clear literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal text and symbols. </li>
					<li>People with dyscalculia may not understand numerical references such as percentages. </li>
					<li>People who struggle with keeping and regaining focus, may be unable to focus on a task if there are lots of distractions and interruptions. They may need headers and signposts to help them regain the context after their attention has been lost (including in multi-media). </li>
					<li>Many groups will need support to minimize errors and complete their task. They will struggle with complex, multi-stage processes that were not necessary for the task at hand such  as filling out forms or entering data correctly or finding the content or feature that they need. </li>

				<p>There is a huge number of cognitive disabilities and variations of them. If we attempt an analysis of all the possibilities, the job will be too big, and nothing will be achieved. Therefore, we are adopting a phased approach, selecting in phase one a limited scope of eight diverse disabilities, and hope to achieve something useful within that scope. Also note that helping users improve skills, and emotional disabilities, are out of scope for phase one. We anticipate this analysis will continue to a second or third phase where more user groups are analyzed, and the existing analyses are updated with new research and with new technologies and scenarios. </p>

				<p>Most designers want people to be able to use their site. However designs that might be difficult for some people to use can actually bar people with cognitive and learning disabilities from using the content at all. Typically this happens because content providers may not be familiar with the needs of users having these impairments. We have reviewed multiple user groups as a first phase to identify user needs and challenges that are not fully included in WCAG.  From this research we have identified techniques and themes though the techniques that authors need to be aware of (and are not full addressed in WCAG 2.0) The key themes are: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Help as many users as possible understand the site and know how to use it. This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design patters. Personalization based on user needs and markup properly annotated with cognitive semantics can help make the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. </li>
					<li>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes when they do occur. A good design and use of proven scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without having to render other data or start from the beginning. </li>
					<li>Help the user to refocus and to restore context if attention is lost. Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes) </li>
				</ol>
				<p>Main techniques include: <!--(Taken from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html</a>) --></p>
				<ul>
					<li> Use a clear structure with easy to follow sections short paragraphs manageable chunks </li>
					<li> Use an easy to follow writing style </li>
					<li> Provide rapid and direct feedback </li>
					<li> Help the user understand the content and orientate themselves in the content. </li>
			        <li>Help users complete and check       their work  to make it       less likely that the user will make mistakes and  easier to       undo mistakes when they occur </li>
				
                  <li> Provide help </li>
                  <li> Help the user focus and help restore the context if attention is lost </li>
                  <li> Enable adaptability and personalization, so that symbols text and other features   are familiar and helpful to the user </li>
                  <li> Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content and avoid barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content, such as hard to use security mechanisms. </li>
                </ul>

				<p>To help bridge the gap we propose the following strategies: </p>
				<p>1. Construct a full list of techniques.<!--: See <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html">https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.html</a>--></p>
				<p>2. Support an extension to [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WCAG">WCAG</a></cite>] that supports the techniques. This will include: </p>
				<ol>
					<li> Writing new WCAG Success criteria and techniques. </li>
					<li> Suggesting changes to existing success criteria such as changing the text or the conformance level </li>
					<li> Proposing new success criteria when necessary. </li>
				</ol>
				(See appendix two for details of the new WCAG Success criteria and techniques.)
				<p>As part of this effort it is important to make this guidance as clear and prescriptive as possible, so that author knows what they need to do and when they have met the requirements. <!--See <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Proposal_for_WCAG">https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Proposal_for_WCAG</a>--></p>
				<p>3. Create a new semantics specification  to define the associated semantics required for content adaptation. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>This could be done via a  WAI- ARIA module or a new Cognitive semantics specification </li>
					<li>The techniques for adaptation <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> use these semantics </li>
					<li>Specify concrete user settings to represent user preferences that can be used to direct a web application on how to modify the content </li>
					
				</ol>
				(See appendix one for details on the proposed semantics.)
				<p>4. Define testing criteria to ensure the authors know when they are done. </p>
				<ol>
					<li>This may include new rule sets </li>
					<li>This may require the creation of a test suite or specification. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>5. Support, and when appropriate, enable better personalization and adaption of content to meet our users' needs. This has the following advantages:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> It reduces the effort needed by the author. The author will just need to enable personalization, which is easier then working on issues such as simplification and clarity. </li>
					<li> Enables author creativity. Ideally an author could create any interface that they wish, but by enabling API's and personalization, our user groups can receive an adapted interface that is suitable for their needs. </li>
					<li> Better accessibility and inclusion. Sometimes, especially with these user groups, user needs can conflict. With adaptability and personalization the interface is personalized to the individuals user needs. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>See the discussion on personalization below. </p>

				<p><strong>What it is:</strong> Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the preferences or needs of the user. Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements (needs). </p>
				<p>We need personalization because: </p>
				<ol>
					<li> Different user needs can conflict. </li>
					<li> Learning new design patterns (and widgets) can be confusing - we want to allow users to stick with what works for them. </li>
					<li> Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it. </li>
					<li> Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility but can often be considered boring design. </li>
					<li> Ability to change levels of complexity (increase or decrease) - As  the person's skills improve or decrease over time or context. </li>
					<li> Enable content providers to really meet the user needs. </li>
				</ol>
				<p>For example, using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web for people who can not remember new symbols (such as some people with memory related impairments like dementia). However, what is familiar for one user may be new for another. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the design and icons simple and familiar. </p>

					<p>Typical configurable features include adjustments such as colors, text and icon size, sounds or mouse double click speed. Current preferences tend to focus on physical needs that help the user use the content and not on cognitive needs and preferences that help the user understand the content. Meta data and ontologies for preferences also currently focus on physical accessibility needs. For our purposes we need the ontologies to support issues such as: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Types of Language support – such as non-literal language or simple language </li>
						<li> Types of Help available </li>
						<li> Types of graphics and symbols </li>

					<p>People with cognitive disabilities can be become daunted, or worse, completely unable to select their desired preferences. Indeed depending on the individual and the technology being used it may be impossible with a supporter's assistance. </p>
					<p>So specific problems for people with cognitive disabilities include: </p>
					<ol>
						<li> Too many settings and/or options for each </li>
						<li> Not knowing what their preferences are in terms of the available technical solutions </li>
						<li> Not being aware of possible solutions </li>
					</ol>
					<p>The use of custom templates of default  preferences for particular groups of users is one method . Selection a base to immediately provided  useful settings  across a wide range of products and services as a starting point. </p>
					<p>Inferring Preferences is one solution but the technology is not yet mature. Another issue is <strong>multiple devices and applications</strong>. </p>
					<p>There is also a significant risk that, if done badly, <strong>user information and vulnerabilities </strong>can be exposed, exposing the most vulnerable users at the greatest risk. </p>
					<p><strong>Interoperable personalization schemes</strong>. Interoperable personalization schemes are where users want or need products and services to be personalized, they would prefer or need this to happen across the widest possible range of products or services. Personalization schemes that deliver this ideal will only succeed if they are standardized and if that standard is adopted by the widest range of product and service providers. However there are many critical issues for any personalization scheme to resolve such as funding and adoption. </p>
					<p>Current works in progress are GPII (See [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-GPII-1">GPII-1</a></cite>] which is compatible with ISO/IEC 24751) and ETSI (see [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ETSI-1">ETSI-1</a></cite>],[<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ETSI-2">ETSI-2</a></cite>], [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ETSI-3">ETSI-3</a></cite>], [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-ETSI-4">ETSI-4</a></cite>]  ) </p>
					<p><br>
		            Another issue is <strong>Contextual personalization</strong> which includes optimizing the personalization of a product or service is to ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the current context of use. For example, settings that will suit the user of a mobile phone in their office or home will not be well suited to that user when they are driving a car. </p>
					<p>Metadata is another related topic. Metadata allows the user to find content that they can use and suites their personal needs and preferences. A lot of work has been done for enabling metadata that helps people with physical disabilities find versions of content that they can use. However the semantics and terms do not support the specific requirements of people with different cognitive disabilities. </p>

						<li>Promote and support advancements in technologies in these area. For example, our recommending for WCAG will be along the lines of "Use semantics and standardized techniques and that enable the content to be adapted to the user scenario and enable additional support " (See appendix two for details.)</li>
						<li>Enable compatibility with standards such as GPII but do not depend on them. </li>
						<li>Develop the semantics and terms to support the specific requirements of people with different cognitive disabilities. (See appendix one for details on the proposed semantics.)</li>

					<p>We need standardized terms and supportive syntax that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations for the individual use, possibly via an aria attribute and personal preferences. </p>
					<p>For example, assume an author can make it programmatically known that a button is used to send an email. At the user end, the button could be rendered with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that are understandable for this particular user. It could automatically integrate with F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that will always be used for send. In addition it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. </p>
					<p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice with user preferences are available Full versions can be found from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>.

					<p>Products  for people who are  non-verbal  often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples'  language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copyright AND  are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use apps or content from a different company. If we enabled  mapping to open sets of symbol codes that, in turn, map to open or proprietary  symbol sets, then they can be interoperable. At the user end ,  the user agent can load the symbols that the user knows. Symbol   sets might still be proprietary but they  would also be interoperable. That means the end  user  could use them across different devices, or any compatible content  or applications. </p>
<p>Our members are working on projects to enable interoperable symbol sets and the semantics that would enable it. Such as (Pseudocode): </p>

					<p>Voice menu systems and Voice XML are used to develop audio and voice response applications similar to automated telephone menu systems. These systems can cause issues for people with cognitive disabilities who may not have the reasoning skills to understand the instructions or have trouble processing the instructions quickly enough while listening to an array of options to choose from. A person with a cognitive disability may have trouble with short-term memory resulting in the inability to remember the number or verbal response required by the application, or may take a longer period of time to verbalize or enter in a response. </p>

					<p>People with various cognitive impairments can have a variety of difficulties with the online payment systems used in e-commerce. These difficulties range from having trouble understanding the instructions and process to be followed to complete a transaction to issues in providing the necessary personal and financial information to make an online payment. If an online payment system requires a lot of user input for required information, the presentation of the input fields could cause a cluttered look, which can be distracting and make it difficult for the user to process the steps to take to complete the transaction, adding to their frustration and stress. If the online payment system has voiced commands, persons with speech perception issues may not be able to fully understand the instructions to respond appropriately. </p>

					<p>The solutions are split into five categories as follows: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> Navigation <ul>
								<li> Standardize any controls, features and navigation in the online payment system for consistency. </li>
								<li> Keep menus short with clear labels and signs. </li>
								<li> Provide ways to navigate back step-by-step or start over. </li>
								<li> Provide prompts and feedback on the user's progress, give appropriate help when an error is encountered. </li>
								<li> Limit the number of options to lower cognitive overload. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Functionality <ul>
								<li> Use CSS to provide the user control of how information is presented, such as: font, font size, line height, spaces between lines of text, the size of click/touch areas, mouse-over highlighting of text, changes of background and text colors. </li>
								<li> Provide user with list of information they need to have ready prior to using the web payment system. </li>
								<li> Provide definitions and explanations for technical terms, acronyms, etc. used by the web payment system. </li>
								<li> Keep alerts and feedback on the screen until the user explicitly dismisses them. </li>
								<li> Provide search capabilities tolerant of misspellings and typos. </li>
								<li> For users with low-literacy or processing impairments, include speaking text/narration. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Content and Text <ul>
								<li> Use plain language and short, concise sentences. </li>
								<li> Use appropriate graphics to enhance understanding. </li>
								<li> Place critical content "above the fold" to avoid scrolling, if possible. </li>
								<li> Use bulleted lists and a single idea per paragraph to make more digestible "chunks" of information. </li>
								<li> Provide meaningful headings. </li>
								<li> Avoid full justification of text (left and right margins) which can cause large white areas between words. </li>
								<li> The line length of text should be less than 70-80 characters. </li>
								<li> Avoid the use of non-literal text and colloquialisms in the text. </li>
								<li> For people with memory limitations, reduce the standard 7 ± 2 elements per screen to 4 ± 2. </li>
								<li> Provide the ability for the user to request longer or shorter content to either increase or decrease details provided. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Layout <ul>
								<li> Use a consistent layout for each page or step in the web payment system. </li>
								<li> Streamline the page and reduce any extra information not key to completing the web transaction. </li>
								<li> Use plenty of white space for an uncluttered look </li>
								<li> Highlight urgent or important information to be easier to find. </li>
								<li> Avoid menus that appear or disappear with mouse hover and text that moves or changes. </li>
								<li> Use high contrast between text and the background. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul>
						<li> Multimedia <ul>
								<li> As applicable, use typical accessibility techniques: captions, audio description, subtitles. </li>
								<li> Use sounds to enhance the visual experience, such as auditory feedback to signal a change of state or completion of an action. </li>
								<li> Avoid animated graphics which can be distracting, or provide controls to allow the user to adjust the speed of the motion. </li>
								<li> Use graphics and icons as navigation aids, or to indicate progression through the steps for completing a web payment transaction. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>

			<p>This section is work in progress for tables format for the coga roadmap and gap analysis. It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
			<p>Each table addresses a group of user needs represented by a few related user stories of the form of "As a <em>&lt;role&gt;,</em> I want <em>&lt;goal/desire&gt;</em> so that <em>&lt;benefit&gt;</em>".</p>
			<p>The tables show how related user needs can be met though:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Authoring techniques for content using HTML.</li>
				<li>How this can be addressed in WCAG. (See appendix two for details.)</li>
				<li>New semantics that may be required to address this user need, such as extra aria attributes. (See appendix one for details on the proposed semantics.)</li>
				<li>Any personalization requirements.</li>
				<li>Operating System support or other support that may be required to meet this user need.</li>

				<p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service.  For example, difficult security mechanisms that require coping or remembering passwords often bar people with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service at all. </p>
				<p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forget passwords I need to be able to use a site without remembering or copying  passwords and user names so that I can use this service.</li>

				<p><strong>About the user:</strong> Distractions can cause people with cognitive disabilities to lose focus on the current action being performed or draw attention away from the primary content and can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid and/or stop them. </p>
				<p>Once people have become distracted it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for people with both low attention and impaired memory such as people with dementia.</p>
				<p>This leads to following user stories: To do - fill in user stories</p>

				<p>About the user: Filling out forms and similar tasks can be overwhelming for most people with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities such as dyslexia or attention related disabilities. Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Many  people learning disability can not  remember numbers such as their post code, Social Security or Credit Card  numbers. Many people even need  to  check their phone number. This makes  entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desk or take a  break.</p>
				<p>Many users find it very difficult to copy information, due to low visual memory or impaired executive function.</p>
				<p>This  leads to the following  user stories:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As a user who needs to look up my       postal code I do not want the session       to time out while I try  to find the information needed.</li>
                  <li>As a user who needs to take  breaks during       tasks like filling in a form,       I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer       crashes so that  I do       not have to start over again, (which can create a cycle and each time I       reenter my data  I am       more ti red and more likely to make       mistakes).</li>
                  <li>As a user with difficulty typing       numbers in the right order,       I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
                  <li>As a user who finds entering       information stressful, I want to enter as little       information as I can so that it is manageable.</li>

<p><strong>User Needs</strong></p>
				<ul>

				<ul>
					<li>location of elements</li>
					<li>symbols </li>
					<li>text used</li>
					<li>how to get help</li>
				</ul>
				<p> However what is familiar for one user may be new for another. So the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user.</p>

			  <p>About  the user: Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues  and/or  language issues that can make remembering numbers while  processing  words, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include  impaired executive function. </p>
			  <p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service.</p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>Voice XML enable  voice dialogs systems and voice browsers. Sometimes the user needs to hold  multiple pieces of transitory information in their  mind, such as the number that is being  presented as an option,  whilst processing the terms that follow.</li>
		      </ul>
			  <p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
			  <ol>
			    <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills I want to be able to get help without going though a voiceML menu system so that I can set an appointment or find out some information</li>
		        <li>As a user who has weak executive       function. I need the process to get help       to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it.</li>
			  
                <li>A user can have trouble identifying the right words to say in a voice menu.</li>
